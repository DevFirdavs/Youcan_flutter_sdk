# YouCan API

A wrappers into the YouCan platform API that enables developers to extend it's features inside a Dart/Flutter project.

<br />

## Motivation

Well, we might need a flexible and easy way to exchange requests form this api to our project, this could get developers to more unnecessary extra work such as dealing with configuring and using the API's multiple endpoints, loose types of the data, the http requests, modeling data...
<br />
<br />

This library aims to cover the developers from all those sides, and provide easy call methods that bring them to the goal.
