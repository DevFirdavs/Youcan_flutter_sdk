# Debugging

You can always check the api endpoint that the data will be requested from before making the actual call, by accessing the `endPoint` member on the query like this:

```dart
// This is the query
final searchQuery = YouCan.instance.products.search("Product 1");

// here we get the endpoint where the data will be requested
String productsEndPoint = searchQuery.endPoint; // https://YOURSTORELINK.com/products?q=Product 1

// and here we make the request on the query and get the actual data from store
List<Product> searchedProducts = await searchQuery.all();
```

:::note
This is valid on almost every other types of query.
