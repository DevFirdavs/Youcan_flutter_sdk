# Login

You can Authenticate you users and get a login token that you can use in future methods with the `login()` method like this:

#### Using `await`/`async`:

```dart
String loginToken = await YouCan.instance.customers.login(
        email: "YOUR EMAIL HERE",
        password: "YOUR PASSWORD HERE",
      );
```

if the user with that email and password exists, a token will be returned to you, you can save it and use it to get the full user informations and manage it in the next methods.
