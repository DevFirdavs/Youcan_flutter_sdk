# Update Account Informations

once a user is authenticated in your app and you got his user token, you can update his account informations using the `updateCustomerAccount()` method.

#### Using `async`/`await`:

```dart
await YouCan.instance.customers.updateCustomerAccount(
     userToken: "USER TOKEN HERE",
     newUserData: NewUserData(
       email: "NEW EMAIL AS EXAMPLE",
       password: "NEW PASSWORD AS EXAMPLE",
       ),
     );
```
