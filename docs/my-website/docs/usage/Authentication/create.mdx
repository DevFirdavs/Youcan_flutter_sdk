# Sign Up / Create A New Customer

You can create ( sign up ) a new customer in your store using the `create()` method, it creates the customer in the store and return a `CustomerCreationResponse` which will contains all the new created user details.

#### Using `await`/`async`:

```dart
CustomerCreationResponse customerCreationResult = await YouCan.instance.customers.create(
        email: "YOUR EMAIL HERE",
        password: "YOUR PASSWORD HERE",
        confirmPassword: "THE PASSWORD CONFIRMATION HERE",
        optionalUserInformations: OptionalUserInformations(
            firstName: 'FIRST NAME',
            lastName: 'LAST NAME',
            city: 'CITY',
            country: 'COUNTRY',
            notes: 'NOTES',
            region: 'REGION',
        ),
      );
```

The `optionalUserInformations` is not required and you can ignore it if you don't need to collect those informations from your customers.
