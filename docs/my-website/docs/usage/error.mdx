# Error Handling

Well, there is some points that you should know and be aware of when using this library.

### Exception when calling the `all()` and `one()` methods

There is two exceptions that you can catch when using the `all()` and `one()` :

#### NotFoundException

Will be throw if the target query response don't exists, not found ( when a **400** status code is got )

#### ServiceNotAvailable

Will be thrown when the YouCan service is unavailable ( when a **500** status code is got )

<br />

You can catch them using `try catch` like this:

```dart
try {
  final response = await YouCan.instance.products.all();
} on NotFoundException catch(e) {
  /*...*/
} on ServiceNotAvailable catch(e) {
  /*...*/
} catch(e) {
  /*...*/
}
```
