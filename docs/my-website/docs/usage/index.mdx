# Usage

In order to configuring the library with your <a href='https://youcan.shop/en/'>YouCan</a> store, you need to set `storeLink` to you store link like this:

```dart title="main.dart"
void main() {
  YouCan.instance.storeLink = "https://example.youcan.shop"; // change it with your store's link
  runApp(myApp());
}

```

That's it! you can now use all the methods provided from the api directly in your app.

<br />

:::tip
We recommend setting your store link in the `main()` before the `runApp()` is called, so it makes it easy to change it in the future.
